Welcome! My name is Jonathan Ern Sheong Lin, and this is my personal site where I blog about life, software, and Christianity.
I live in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia.

I am a University of California, Berkeley alum with degrees in [EECS](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/) and Physics. In March 2015, I joined [BAE Systems Applied Intelligence](http://www.baesystems.com/ai) as a Software Developer working to protect and enhance business operations the connected world.

Previous working experiences:

- Software consultant at [Belian Tech](http://beliantech.com), where I worked on Ruby on Rails apps. Currently a limited part-time effort.
- Mobile software engineer at [Snappymob](https://www.snappymob.com). I helped churn out the Android and BlackBerry apps for The Malaysian Insider,
as well as contributed to the development of Saved for iOS and Android, a budgeting and expenses app.
- Web software engineer at [Ocision](http://www.ocision.com), now a subsidiary of Star Media Group. Our products include [Propwall](http://www.propwall.com), [iBilik](http://www.ibilik.com), and [Carsifu](http://www.carsifu.my).

During my downtime, I enjoy jogging, swimming, badminton, playing the guitar, hanging out with friends, writing, and reading.

I am a Christian, having been saved by a God who unfailingly pursues me with his love and forgiveness.
He gives me hope for a future while I struggle with the present.

I can be contacted at the concatenation of "ernsheong", "@", and "gmail.com".
