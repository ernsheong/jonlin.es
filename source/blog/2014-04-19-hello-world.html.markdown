I would like to thank Allen of [Snappymob](http://www.snappymob.com) for allowing
me to build a personal site at work.
We occasionally have twenty-percent time, where on Fridays we work on side projects
or sometimes anything we fancy.

One Friday, I was itching to do something for myself, and Allen
graciously gave the green light to hack a personal site.

I have been wanting to code something for myself (as opposed to writing company software), and so
here is an attempt towards some sense of personal achievement.

Here, I hope to write about topics that interest me, including software, insights, opinions, etc.
I also hope to delve into photography, and feature some shots here from time to time.

Stay tuned!
