title: JonLin.es gets a redesign
tags: general

I was lazy when I first launched this website. I built v1 of this site without any prior design. I ended up spending a lot more time than necessary doing small
tweaks everywhere just because the design was not set in stone before development began.

Then [Sketch 3](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/) was released, and suddenly designing became so much easier. (Photoshop was too complex for me and I never got around to learning it.)
I used Sketch to design this entire website before writing any HTML or CSS.

<div class="caption">Before</div>

<img src="/images/website-before.png" />

<div class="caption">After</div>

<img src="/images/website-after.png" />

And so here it is. Hosted on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), and powered by the [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) static website generator, alongside [uikit](http://getuikit.com) the CSS framework
and [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for some nice social icons.

Hopefully I'll now be able to get down to some serious writing!
