Most people live it safe. I'm not saying that they prefer stable jobs over entrepreneurship, but rather that they prefer to keep their time, money, and skills for themselves, rather than be generous with it. It might also be a preference for a stable job over one that has greater humanitarian or societal impact. Or it might be the reluctance to simply be generous with even our small change. We are afraid that we would lose out if we gave more of ourselves.

What if we gave some money to *every* person who asks for donation or alms by the street? More often than not we tend not to glance at them, or walk quickly away, to avoid the guilt of not wanting to give some of what we have away. Well, I do.

What if, instead of hanging out with friends in posh cafes and restaurants in Jalan Telawi, we spent time in charity homes or for good causes? I often do not even dare to venture giving my time to better causes, choosing instead the comfortable vicinity of friends and food, as well as keeping to my own little world of life habits.

The other day I saw a row of shiny luxury cars in front of a shopping center. Shiny cars just seem like a total waste of resources. Surely much good could have been done if they were channeled somewhere else?

On one hand, we should not be legalistic about life. Good times with friends over a nice meal are great, and are relationship bridges over which the gospel might possibly pass through one day. On the other hand, the life of safety and comfort is becoming increasingly unbearable and empty. Years from now, I fear looking back and wondering why I've spent it all on myself.

Also, when we live safely and have lots of backup money in fixed deposits and in the stock market, we miss out on the opportunity to experience God's miraculous ability to provide in our times of need. Our self-sufficiency deprives us of our dependence of God. Surrendering our lives to Christ was at one point losing our lives, but it's just too easy after the fact to revert back to keeping our lives, and only giving away bits and pieces gradually to appease God and our consciences.

I don't dare to commit to living "dangerously", but it's something that appeals to me. Maybe I will gradually find the courage to live more and more "dangerously" as I grow older.
